## Getting Started

For this tutorial, you need to have OmegaT install on your computer. You can find the version that suit you with this [link] (https://omegat.org/download).


## Doing exercises

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the subdirectory `OmegaTutorial/exercises/<topic>`. For every topic there is an additional README file with some resources to get you started on the topic. We really recommend that you have a look at them before you start.

The task is simple. Most exercises contain untranslated sentences that need to be translated.
